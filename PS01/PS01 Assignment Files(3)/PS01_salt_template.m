%% ____________________
%% INITIALIZATION

% Create seven (7) variables and set them equal to the values provided in 
% the problem setup: cone width, number of conical piles, windrow width,
% windrow length, number of windrow piles, angle of repose, and density of
% salt



%% ____________________
%% CALCULATIONS

% Convert salt density to (metric ton)/m^3 using the conversion constants:
% 1 kg = 2.2 lb, 1 mt = 1000 kg, 1 m = 3.3 ft 


% Calculate the height, volume, and weight of salt in a single conical pile 


% Calculate the height, volume, and weight of salt in a single windrow pile


% Calculate how much salt, in metric tons, can be stored in the specificed
% number of conical piles and windrow piles



%% ____________________
%% FORMATTED TEXT & FIGURE DISPLAYS

% Print the height and weight of one conical pile to the Command Window.
%   Replace var1 with your variable for height.
%   Replace var2 with your variable for weight.
%   Do not hardcode any values.
fprintf('The height of one conical pile is %0.2f m and its weight is %.1f mt.\n',var1,var2)

% Print the height and weight of one windrow pile to the Command Window.
%   Replace var3 with your variable for height.
%   Replace var4 with your variable for weight.
%   Do not hardcode any values.
fprintf('The height of one windrow pile is %0.2f m and its weight is %.1f mt.\n',var3,var4)

% Print the total weight and number of conical piles to the Command Window.
%   Replace var5 with your variable for number of piles.
%   Replace var6 with your variable for weight.
%   Do not hardcode any numerical values.
fprintf('The weight of %i conical piles is %0.0f mt.\n',var5,var6)

% Print the total weight and number of windrow piles to the Command Window.
%   Replace var7 with your variable for number of piles.
%   Replace var8 with your variable for weight.
%   Do not hardcode any numerical values.
fprintf('The weight of %i windrow piles is %0.0f mt.\n',var7,var8)
